Roadmap for a new Python C API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Roadmap
=======

* Step 1: Identify :ref:`Bad C API <bad-c-api>` and list functions that should
  be modified or even removed
* Step 2: Add an **opt-in** :ref:`new C API <new-c-api>` with these cleanups. Test :ref:`popular
  C extensions <consumers>` to measure how much code is broken. Start to fix
  these C extensions by making them **forward** compatible. Slowly involve more
  and more players into the game.
* Step 3: :ref:`Remove more functions <remove-funcs>`. Maybe replace
  :ref:`Py_INCREF() macro <incref>` with a function call. Finish to hide all C
  structures especially ``PyObject.ob_refcnt``. Measure the performance.
  Decide what to do.
* Step 4: if step 3 gone fine and most people are still ok to continue, make
  the :ref:`new C API <new-c-api>` as the default in CPython and add an option
  for **opt-out** to stick with the :ref:`old C API <old-c-api>`.

Open questions
==============

* Remove or deprecate APIs using borrowed references? If ``PyTuple_GetItem()``
  must be replaced with ``PyTuple_GetItemRef()``, how do we provide
  ``PyTuple_GetItemRef()`` for Python 3.7 and older? See :ref:`Backward
  compatibility <back-compat>`.

Status
======

* 2018-07-29: `pythoncapi project <https://github.com/vstinner/pythoncapi>`_
  created on GitHub
* 2017-12-21: It's an idea. There is an old PEP draft, but no implementation,
  the PEP has no number and was not accepted yet (nor really proposed).

Players
=======

* CPython: Victor Stinner
* PyPy :ref:`cpyext <cpyext>`: Ronan Lamy
* :ref:`Cython <cython>`: Stefan Behnel

Unknown status:

* `RustPython <https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython>`_
* MicroPython?
* IronPython?
* Jython?
* Pyjion
* Pyston
* any other?

Timeline
========

* 2018-06: capi-sig mailing list migrated to Mailman 3
* 2017-11: Idea proposed on python-dev, `[Python-Dev] Make the stable API-ABI
  usable
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-November/150607.html>`_
* 2017-09: Blog post: `A New C API for CPython
  <https://vstinner.github.io/new-python-c-api.html>`_
* 2017-09: Idea discussed at the CPython sprint at Instagram (California).
  Liked by all core developers. The expected performance slowdown is likely to
  be accepted.
* 2017-07: Idea proposed on python-ideas. `[Python-ideas] PEP: Hide
  implementation details in the C API
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2017-July/046399.html>`_
* 2017-05: Idea proposed at the Python Language Summit, during PyCon US 2017.
